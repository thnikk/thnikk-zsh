This theme is based off of the wonderful spaceship theme, but I didn't want all of the git functionality becaue bloat. It features:

- Username and hostname
- Ligature used instead of tiny arrow (This requires a font like FiraCode.)
- Fun colors
- Prompt on second line so you always start typing at the same place
