# thnikk zsh theme

This is a very stripped down version of the spaceship theme since I don't care to use any of the git and similar functionality. It features:

- Username and hostname
- Ligature used instead of tiny arrow (This requires a font like FiraCode.)
- Fun colors
- Prompt on second line so you always start typing at the same place
- Truncated directories past a depth of two (ie ../polybar/scripts)
